#Short Explanation
"Using an array helped me organize and access the data more efficiently and effectively while having less lines."
"It helped me be more organized with the data since it is less confusing to the eyes of the programmer."
"There wasn't any particualr part of the data that was difficult to summarize since it was quite the easy data to understand."
