#Reflection
"I chose the dataset of temperatures for two cities over a week because it is simple and easy to understand."
"It allows me to demonstrate how to access and modify elements in a 2D list effectively."
"It is also much more faster to do because I think it has less values to compute."
"The 2D array helped me organize the data in a way that is easy to understand and access the value effectively and efficiently."
